      <h2>About</h2>
      <h3>About The Site</h3>
      <p>This site contains a collection of online tools for text-based file formatter, especially for files related to the web. People who are assigned to maintain source code will most likely have difficulty in updating the code provided by clients in a compressed, minified or even in an obfuscated style. These tools are very suitable for those who want to solve that-kind of problems.</p>

If one day, there are some unexpected things happen on this site, then the only person who is responsible for the chaos is me, Taufik Nurrohman and not the main owner of <a href="https://js.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">js.org</a> domain.</p>

      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>I probably will keep statistics of your visits to some of the pages on this site, but I&rsquo;m not going to take and record the codes that you try to tidy. Some data such as the checked status on every check-box elements in the form are stored via the local storage features on your device.</p>
